===================

This project is part of a tutorial I wrote for [Ray Wenderlich's site](http://www.raywenderlich.com/).

You can see the first part of the tutorial [here](http://www.raywenderlich.com/4756/how-to-make-a-catapult-shooting-game-with-cocos2d-and-box2d-part-1) and the second part  [here](http://www.raywenderlich.com/4756/how-to-make-a-catapult-shooting-game-with-cocos2d-and-box2d-part-2).

There's an improved version in the app store that I made for an upcoming tutorial [here](http://itunes.apple.com/app/cute-a-pult/id493436659?mt=8)
